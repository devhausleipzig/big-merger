# Big Merger

This is a git merging exercise to do as a team

## Goal

- Try to add new entries to the individual files to share them with the rest of the team.

## Rules

- Never directly commit to master, you may only merge
- In each commit only edit a single file
- The entries in each file always have to stay in alphabetical order and contain no duplicates

## Hint

- Constantly talk to each other and strategize around
- Feel free to add extra branches just for premerging in preparation
- Come up with a branch naming strategy, e.g. feature + name: books-franz
- Use pull requests to merge into master, so you can check the changes in the github ui
